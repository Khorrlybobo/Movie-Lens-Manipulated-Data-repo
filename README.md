# Movie-Lens-Manipulated-Data-repo

    This project utilizes data science and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from a large dataset of movie ratings. By analyzing patterns and trends in user ratings, the algorithm is able to identify key factors that influence viewers' opinions of movies. This information can be leveraged by filmmakers and studios to make data-driven decisions when creating new content, as well as by streaming services and recommendation engines to provide personalized recommendations to users. The code is built in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data processing and machine learning tasks. With its innovative approach to movie rating analysis, this project aims to provide valuable insights to the entertainment industry and enhance the overall movie-watching experience for viewers.
